# Pizza Sales SQL Data Analyst Project

## Project Background
Understanding customer preferences and sales performance is crucial in the food service industry. This project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL, uncovering key business insights that can drive data driven decisions. By examining various aspects of sales data such as order trends, product performance, and revenue patterns we can identify opportunities for business growth and optimization.

Our analysis follows a structured methodology that includes:

- **Database Initialization & Exploration**: Establishing a well-structured database and understanding its schema to ensure a solid foundation for analysis.  
- **Dimension & Date Range Exploration**: Investigating different factors affecting sales, including product variety, order sizes, and seasonal trends.  
- **Sales Performance Evaluation**: Analyzing revenue, order volume, and other key measures to assess business performance.  
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conducting magnitude analysis, ranking evaluations, and tracking sales changes over time to derive meaningful insights.  

Through this analysis, we aim to support better decision-making regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation.

### Sales Trends
The data reveals:
- A steady **increase in total orders (7.55%)** compared to the previous period.
- An **income growth of 8.04%**, indicating higher revenue generation.
- Significant variation in pizza sales, with some categories experiencing growth while others decline.
- **Weekday sales trends**, with peak orders on specific days.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. **Optimize inventory management**: Given the fluctuating demand for different pizza types, ensuring optimal stock levels can minimize waste and maximize profitability.
2. **Targeted promotions**: High-performing pizza categories should be promoted through marketing campaigns, while declining categories might need adjustments or seasonal offerings.
3. **Enhance customer segmentation**: Understanding which customer segments drive the most sales can help tailor promotions and loyalty programs.
4. **Monitor weekday sales variations**: Special promotions can be introduced on lower-performing days to balance sales distribution.
5. **Expand top-performing products**: Since some pizzas significantly outperform others, introducing variations or bundles of these best-sellers could increase revenue.

By leveraging SQL-based data analysis, these insights can drive better business decisions, improve sales strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.
